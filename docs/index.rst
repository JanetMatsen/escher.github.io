Welcome to the documentation for **Escher**
===========================================

Escher is a web-based tool for building, viewing, and sharing visualizations of
biological pathways. These 'pathway maps' are a great way to contextualize
biological datasets. The easiest way to use Escher is to browse and build maps
on the `Escher website`_. New users may be interested in the
:doc:`getting_started` guide.

Help! I just upgraded to v1.2 and my map and model caches are empty!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting with Escher v1.2, the maps and models available from the Escher website
are versioned. Each time you upgrade Escher, you will have access to the new
versions of the Escher maps and models. Any maps and models you were using
before are still saved in the Escher cache in case you need them. For more
details on finding, managing, and clearing the cache, see :ref:`the Python cache
functions<cache>`.

Also starting with Escher v1.2, the maps and models in Escher are the same as
those in the `BiGG Database`_.

Escher can be used without any installation by visiting the `Escher
website`_. However, you can install escher if you would like to (1) run Escher
offline, (2) include your own maps and models in the launch page, (3) view Escher maps
in an IPython Notebook, or (4) modify the source code. 

To install the latest stable version of Escher, run::

    pip install escher

For more information, see the documentation on :doc:`ipython_notebook` and
:doc:`development`.

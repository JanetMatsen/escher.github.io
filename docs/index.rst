Welcome to the documentation for **Escher**
===========================================

Escher is a web-based tool for building, viewing, and sharing visualizations of
metabolic pathways. These 'pathway maps' are a great way to contextualize data
about metabolism. The easiest way to use Escher is to browse or build maps on
the `Escher website`_.
